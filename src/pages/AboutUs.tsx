              We're a team of five food addicts bound by one belief: good food is the foundations of happiness.

            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Our story began as friends obsessed with the kind of dishes that make you pause mid-conversation, 
              look each other in the eye, and say, <em>"Wow‚Ä¶ this is ****** good."</em>
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We've travelled across continents, tasting thousands of dishes from different places ‚Äî from the 
              local night markets to Michelin-starred kitchens. We weren't searching for fancy experiences but 
              for the kind of dishes that stop you from talking. Recipes that deserve to be shared.
            </p>

                The 5-Clover in our logo represents the blend of who we are:

              <ul className="space-y-2 text-foreground">
                <li>‚Ä¢ Two classically-trained chefs with years of experience everywhere ‚Äî from fine-dining restaurants to street food shops.</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ A second-generation family-restaurant owner carrying her grandparents' timeless recipes and decades of know-how.</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ A second-generation wholesaler who knows how to source the freshest, best-quality ingredients.</li>
                <li>‚Ä¢ A tech nerd whose first love has always been food.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Together, we bring these experiences to re-create classic dishes from around the world ‚Äî with a refined touch. 
              Our goal isn't to reinvent what people already love, but to honor it, refine it, and make it more accessible.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We believe food has the power to bring people together, make memories, and create joy. That's what we 
              strive for every day ‚Äî not because we think our food alone brings happiness, but because sharing a good 
              meal is often where happiness begins.
